Hello from a peaceful software guy, who had been doing low level programming and verification works for some years, and has recently been fascinated with iOS app development. 

This blog was built in order to summarize and share knowledge and ideas. For now, most posts will be concerning Swift and iOS app development, maybe a few others with different subjects for distraction. 

If you are interested in Swift and iOS app development, take your time scrolling around, you might find something you like.

Cheers.
