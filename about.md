I'm a software guy, and I had been doing some low level verification and programming works. Last year(2016), I found myself getting interested in iOS app develepment and I've started my journey of learning and using it ever since. 

I setup this blog to summarize and save the things that are important to me in this journey. In this early stage, most of them will be what I've learned from other great ideas and methods, summaries of a protocol in a spec, my own experiences and thoughts about my projects, and maybe a few other topics for distraction. 

Take your time scrolling around, you might find something you like.
