**How Google Domains and Github Pages helped me to give birth to lazyself.io...**

<!--more-->

Finally, lazyself comes to life after a whole week's effort. Hooray! For now, it's simple and flat, with basic functions for a personal blog. During its growth, necessary features and decors would be gained. I want to use this first post to record the birth of this blog.  

I used to use blogging platforms, like the long gone Windows Live Spaces, now the WordPress. They are well developed, user friendly, with ready-to-use features and themes, all you need is to sign on, and you are good to go. The one and only issue I have with these platforms is that my domain has to be composed from their domains. In order to have my own domain, I decided to register a domain name at Google Domains.
